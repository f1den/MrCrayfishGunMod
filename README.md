# MrCrayfish's Gun Mod

MrCrayfish's Gun Mod is a new and exciting weapon mod with a unique vision. Adding nine weapons, all can be highly customised to create your own unique variant. Using attachments and enchantments, you can increase the stats of a weapon to create an even more powerful version. Dyes can be used to change the colour of any weapon and attachment. This mod also adds grenades and stun grenades!

### Modpack Developers / Server Owners:
As of version 1.0, the mod is now data driven. This means in order to change the properties of a weapon, you must now use a datapack instead of the config file. This allows myself to patch the default properties of weapons while still allowing everyone to customise as needed. Template coming soon!

### How to Create an Addon:

*OUTDATED. Please stand by while this is updated to 1.0.0. Thank you!*

MrCrayfish's Gun Mod now makes it possible to create addons as of version (1.13.1) and allows you create new weapons, ammo, and projectiles in a very small amount of code. If you are interested in developing an addon and/or potentially getting it featured on this page, you can check out the example mod I wrote. Feel free to use this project as a base of your own addon. Documentation is still a work in progress and will be updated soon.
